				nobody has to go a single day without a meal. Additionally, we recognize that every day thousands of
				meals in restaurants go to waste at closing time. That's why we have made a service where restaurants
				in the surrounding area are able to sell their extra plates at a discounted price. This allows them to
				recoup some losses, but also allows us to provide a service where people in need are able to eat. So 
				weather you're just here to buy from local restaurant, or you're somone who's willing and able to donate
				to those who need it, you are supporting a greater cause.</p>
