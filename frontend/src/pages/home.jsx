			 nobody has to go a single day without a meal. Additionally, we recognize that every days thousands of
			 meals in restaurants go to waste at the end of the day. That's why we have made a service where restaurants
			 in the surrounding area are able to sell their extra plates at a discounted price, allowing them to
			 recoup some losses, but also allowing us to provide a service where people in need are able to eat.</p>
